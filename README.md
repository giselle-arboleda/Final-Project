# Final-Project
## Housemate-Pro

We are designing a responsive web application for students that live with other people. The goal is to eliminate tension that some households have between housemates. In the app, users can be assigned chores. Once the chore is completed, it can be marked as ‘complete’ within the app. Thus, the completion of household chores will be facilitated through the app rather than in person confrontation.
